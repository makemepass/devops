1) Make sure you are inside your project folder
Example:
cd C:\Users\nosha\devops_story_book

2) Create a new branch
git checkout -b bio-update
This creates and switches to a new branch.

3) Create a file (or edit an existing one)
Let’s create a simple file named bio.txt:
echo My hobbies: > bio.txt
echo - Reading >> bio.txt
echo - Coding >> bio.txt
echo - Playing games >> bio.txt
If you're on Ubuntu/Bash, same commands work.
If you're on PowerShell, also works fine.

4) Add the file to Git
git add bio.txt

5) Commit the change
git commit -m "Added hobbies to bio.txt"

6) Push the branch to GitHub
Replace the URL if needed.
git push -u origin bio-update
